<h2 id="todays-diary">Today’s Diary</h2>
<p>At last, I made my homepage. At first, I tried to make a bling bling homepage. But I thought I didn’t know when to stop writing diary and running the homepage. So I decieded to make a simple homepage using github.
although I used github, it is so difficult to create a homepage. I surfed the internet to find how to make a homepage and found them.
I made a homepage referring the two sites below.</p>

<p>https://devinlife.com/howto%20github%20pages/blog-config/
  https://dreamgonfly.github.io/blog/jekyll-remote-theme/</p>

<p>Not to forget, write down the two sites…..
I made it hard for my part, but it still lacks a lot of features.
Someday, it will get better. I believe…</p>
